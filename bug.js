This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized. This often happens when using `useState` hook and accessing the state variable inside a `useEffect` hook before the component has rendered at least once.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Count:', count); // Error: count is undefined
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
