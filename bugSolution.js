The solution involves making sure that `useEffect` only runs *after* the state variable has been initialized. We can achieve this by adding `count` to the dependency array.  The effect will now only trigger when `count` changes.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Count:', count); // Now works correctly
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Alternatively, you could use a conditional rendering to ensure that the effect only runs after the state is initialized or use a `null` check before using the `count` variable inside the useEffect hook.
